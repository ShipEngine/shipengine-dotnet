### Setup

- Install [.NET 5.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)

```
%> dotnet restore
%> dotnet tool restore

Please run dotnet format before pushing changes

%> dotnet format
```

## TESTS

Run the following command:

```
%> dotnet test
```

By default, the test project targets all supported frameworks, if your environment only supports a subset then you
can specify in the CLI.

```
%> dotnet test -f net5.0
```

Run tests on file change:

```
%> dotnet watch -p ShipEngine.tests/ test
```

## Release

In the `ShipEngine.csproj` file, update to the desired version and push to the `main` branch.
The [Publish NuGet Github Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/publish-nuget) will handle all the necessary github tags and nuget packaging and publishing.
